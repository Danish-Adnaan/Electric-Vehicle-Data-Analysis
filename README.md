# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset related to electric vehicles (EVs). The dataset contains various features such as electric range, energy consumption, price, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights, tell a compelling story, perform hypothesis testing, and provide actionable recommendations based on the data.

## Dataset

## Tools Used
- Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and others as needed

## Instructions
- Write clean, structured code with explanations to guide readers through your analysis.
- Each task requires a coding solution and a written section explaining findings.

## Tasks

### Task 1
- Filter electric vehicles within budget (350,000 PLN) and minimum range (400 km).
- Group the filtered EVs by manufacturer (Make).
- Calculate the average battery capacity for each manufacturer.

### Task 2
- Detect outliers in the "Mean Energy consumption [kWh/100 km]" column to identify EVs with unusually high or low consumption.

### Task 3
- Visualize the relationship between battery capacity and range using an appropriate plot.
- Provide insights based on the visualization.

### Task 4
- Build an EV recommendation class that accepts user input for budget, desired range, and battery capacity.
- The class should return the top three EVs matching the criteria.

### Task 5
- Perform hypothesis testing (two-sample t-test) to check if there is a significant difference in average engine power ([KM]) between Tesla and Audi vehicles.
- Draw insights from the test results.

## Recommendations and Conclusion
- Summarize actionable insights derived from the data analysis and hypothesis testing to guide decision-making.
